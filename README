==============================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

A Django application for easily design a newsletter in EDN.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

EDLD is an extension af the EDN admin app developped by emancia. To make
it works, installing the EDN app in your django project is mandatory.

Please take a tour to the EDN install guide for a good start. Then make your
newsletter editing easier with the layout designer::

    http//github.com/Fantomas42/emencia-django-newsletter


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unfortunatally this module is not released yet. But you can install it simply
as follow after coling the main github repository of the project::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/pygloo/emencia-django-layout-designer.git
    cd emencia-django-layout-designer
    python setup.py install (or develop)


This module is essencially based on a YUI3 client named `bewype-layout-designer`
and it should be retrieved seperately for another github repo as follow::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/pygloo/bewype-yui3-gallery.git


Then we need to make a symbolic link of the builded YUI3 resources in the media
folder of the django module as follow::

    cd ~/emencia-django-layout-designer
    cd emencia/django/layout/designer
    cd media/edld/js
    ln -s ~/bewype-yui3-gallery/build bewype-yui3-gallery
    

Should be ok for the modules files. Let's configure it now ;)


The settings file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add `'django_wysiwyg'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'emencia.django.layout.designer',
    )


The urls file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is were everything happen for your app ...


Admin import
------------

First we assume that the application has its admin part activated as follow.
Here is how we import the required modules and init them to do so::

    # Uncomment the next two lines to enable the admin:
    from django.contrib import admin
    admin.autodiscover()


Additionally, we need to the admin form field named `content` that should
implement our `LayoutDesignerWidget` widget. We wrote a simple admin module in
the edld module to make it fast. Then a simple import, after the
admin import and autodiscover lines do the job::
    
    # ...
    from emencia.django.layout.designer import admin_edn


Url patterns
------------

Here how you can set your urls now::

    # django import
    from django.conf.urls.defaults import include, patterns, url

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        ...
        url(r'^edld/', include('emencia.django.layout.designer.urls')),
        url(r'^newsletters/', include('emencia.django.newsletter.urls')),
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        ...
    )


Ok, maybe you need to deliver your files locally for some development reasons::

    # ... a site settings
    from  asite import settings

    if settings.DEBUG:
        urlpatterns += patterns('django.views.static',
                       ...
                       url(r'^edn/(?P<path>.*)$', 'serve',
                           {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT + '/edn'}),
                       url(r'^edld/(?P<path>.*)$', 'serve',
                           {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT + '/edld'}),
                       ...
                       )


The upload issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To manage file uploading in the layout designer you should create an uploads
under the /media/edld folder as follow::

    /media/edld/css
    /media/edld/js
    /media/edld/uploads


All uploaded files will go there using a random name and will be available
according the same mechanism::

    ...
    <img src="/edld/uploads/XosvPkOfEZOOziCRaTnwvQMB" ...>


Note: may be this hard coded way of managing upload will move to a more generic
and configurable way of doing ...


Usage
~~~~~

From the `http://www.yoursite.com/admin/` url nothing has changed. Just go to
the `Newsletter` submenu and again nothing has changed. Change appears when
you add a new `Newsletter`. Now the old fashion way `textarea` should have
disappeared.

He is the point. It as been replaced by our designer. How it works? At start
we just see the blue line we everything start. When we move our mouse over this
line it opens and it shows 2 images:

    * add a column
    * add a row


Then another, blue again, line appears. This line offer new possiblities:

    * add a row (if column) || add a column (if row)
    * add a text
    * add an image
    * remove the column (if column) || remove the row (if row)


For example if we click on the icon `add text` a new empty cell should appear.
3 icons are present in the bottom right part of this cell:

    * move (for d'n'd issues)
    * edit to change text and everything
    * remove cell


... your turn!
